            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Maheshwar for me is the city of Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar. She moved the capital of Holkarâ€™s from Indore to this place on the banks of Narmada River. This is where she ruled from, driving her strength from her faith in Shiva and Narmada. At this place, you are never far away from the Narmada.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It is an ancient town on the banks of the Narmada River. In ancient Indian scriptures, it is mentioned as Mahishmati. Yes, the same name you might have heard in the blockbuster Bahubali. This is supposed to be a place where Ravan was held prisoner for 6 months by king Sahastrarjun. His temple can be seen at the RajRajeshwar temple complex. Both, our epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata mention Maheshwar. It was also a part of Avanti that we better know as Ujjain.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Maheshwar is a town, near Khargone city in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh state, 
            in central India. It is located on State Highway-38,13.5 km east of National Highway 3 and 91 km from Indore, 
            the commercial capital of the state. The Town lies on the north bank of the Narmada River.
            Maheshwar is believed to be built on the site of the ancient city of Somvanshya Shastrarjun Kshatriya, and was the capital of king Kartavirya Arjuna, (Shree Shastrarjun) who is mentioned in the Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.  </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In one of the open corridors or veranda is where Rani Ahilya Bai used to have her Gaadi or the court. This is where she sat with a Shivalinga in her hand, listened to her people, and did justice. The place is maintained as it used to be. Surrounded by wooden pillars with a cotton mattress, there is now a life-size statue of Ahilya Bai. On top are the portraits of various Holkars. What I liked the most was a long mural depicting the Maheshwar Fort from the Narmada. What remains with you is the innate simplicity of Maheshwar Rajwada, which is a reflection of the simplicity of the queen who ruled from here.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Situated on the banks of river Narmada, Maheshwar appeals to both, the pilgrim as well as the tourist in you. The town possesses a treasure trove of beautiful temples that calm the soul, alongside man-made creations that please the eyes.

            A centre of handloom weaving since the 5th century, Maheshwar has been producing the exquisite Maheshwari sarees and fabric. The town also holds the distinction of being the capital of Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar's empire during the 18th century.
            
            This historic town weaves spirituality and folklore with the beauty of nature and Maheshwari sarees, bringing alive child-like awe in you.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"> MAHESHWAR Saari's </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The biggest living legacy of Rani Ahilya Bai is Maheshwari Sari. The town has become synonymous with the weave. Weaving sustains the majority population of this town. Wherever you walk in the town, colorful handloom Saris are never out of sight. In the weaving quarters, you hear the rhythmic sound of handlooms as the weavers weave thread by thread.</p>
        <p class="para1">Where to buy Maheshwari Sari?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">To see the handlooms, the best place is to visit the Rehwa Society looms. Rehwas is an NGO run by Richard Holkar and his wife. As you would expect their prime target market is foreigners and so their designs and range cater more to them. You can definitely buy Saris, stoles, shawls, and fabric from them.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is a small poorly maintained museum little away from the main city or the fort. We had to ask quite a few people before we could locate it. It has a good collection of antiquities from Khargone district under which Maheshwar falls.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Around this destination, you can visit the Sahastradhara. You can visit it by boat ride where the river passes through many big and small rocks. I could not visit it as it was raining and everyone advised us against visiting it.</p>
